                            Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own right outside of Council Bluffs.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope that your family gets as much enjoyment out of this years Corn Maze as we did building it! Our family would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at this years Corn Maze and AutumnFest.

                The Sunny Acres Petting Barn, conveniently located northeast of Council Bluffs, is a perfect setting for people of all ages to learn about farming and farm animals. 
                At our farm you can enjoy over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean, relaxed, hands-on environment. 
                The kids can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs, and calves in the Nursery and Bottle Baby pens.
                Come join us for a fun-filled day.
